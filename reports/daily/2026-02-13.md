# AI Agent Research Daily Digest — 2026-02-13

## 🔥 Top Discoveries

### 1. GitHub Agentic Workflows — Plain Markdown CI with AI Agents
- **Link:** https://github.blog/changelog/2026-02-13-github-agentic-workflows-are-now-in-technical-preview/
- **What:** GitHub's new technical preview lets you write CI/CD workflows in plain Markdown instead of YAML. Drop a `.md` file in `.github/workflows/`, describe what you want in natural language, and AI agents (Copilot CLI or others) execute it within GitHub Actions. The `gh aw` CLI compiles Markdown → Actions workflows.
- **Key details:** Read-only by default, sandboxed execution, network isolation, SHA-pinned deps. Uses GitHub MCP Server for native access to repos/issues/PRs. Supports multiple coding agent backends.
- **Why interesting:** This is GitHub making agentic CI a first-class citizen. Combined with yesterday's "Continuous AI" announcement, they're building the full stack: Markdown workflows → agentic execution → Agent HQ orchestration. The security-first design (read-only default, safe outputs for writes) shows they've learned from the matplotlib PR fiasco. Open source under MIT.
- **Relevance:** Direct follow-up to yesterday's GitHub Continuous AI item — now with a concrete developer tool.

### 2. Google DeepMind Aletheia — Autonomous AI Research Agent
- **Link:** https://github.com/google-deepmind/superhuman/blob/main/aletheia/Aletheia.pdf
- **HN:** 947 pts (via Gemini 3 Deep Think announcement)
- **What:** An AI agent that bridges competition math and professional research. Uses an agentic loop: Generator → Verifier → Reviser, powered by Gemini Deep Think. Already contributed to peer-reviewed papers — including one fully autonomous paper (Feng26) with zero human intervention.
- **Key results:** 95.1% on IMO-Proof Bench Advanced (prev record: 65.7%). Jan 2026 Deep Think uses 100x less compute than 2025 version for IMO-level problems. Uses Google Search to prevent citation hallucinations.
- **Why interesting:** This is the clearest demonstration yet of AI doing genuine autonomous research, not just coding tasks. The Generator/Verifier/Reviser pattern is a reusable architecture for any high-stakes agentic task. The verification separation insight — models catch flaws they miss during generation — is applicable to coding agents too.

### 3. GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark — Real-Time Coding Model on Cerebras
- **Link:** https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5-3-codex-spark/
- **HN:** 807 pts, 351 comments
- **What:** OpenAI's first model designed for real-time interactive coding. A smaller variant of GPT-5.3-Codex, optimized for Cerebras hardware delivering 1000+ tokens/sec. 128k context, text-only. Research preview for ChatGPT Pro users.
- **Key insight:** Codex now has two modes — long-running autonomous tasks (hours/days) AND real-time interactive editing. Spark makes minimal targeted edits by default, doesn't auto-run tests unless asked.
- **Why interesting:** The Cerebras partnership is paying off — 1000 tok/s changes the UX of coding agents fundamentally. At that speed, the agent feels like a collaborator, not a batch job. This is OpenAI's answer to the "harness matters" argument (see #4).

### 4. "The Harness Problem" — Improving 15 LLMs by Changing Only the Edit Tool
- **Link:** https://blog.can.ac/2026/02/12/the-harness-problem/
- **Repo:** https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi (fork of Pi coding agent)
- **HN:** 729 pts, 267 comments
- **What:** Developer maintains a fork of the Pi coding agent with ~1,300 commits. Changed a single variable — the edit tool implementation — and improved coding performance across 15 different LLMs. The post argues the industry is asking "which model is best?" when they should be asking "which harness is best?"
- **Key insight:** Claude Code "leaks raw JSONL from sub-agent outputs, wasting hundreds of thousands of tokens." The harness (tool schemas, error messages, state management) is where most failures happen in practice, not the model itself.
- **Why interesting:** This is the most important meta-insight in the coding agent space right now. Model-agnostic harness improvements have multiplicative impact. Directly relevant to anyone building or using coding agents. The oh-my-pi repo is worth watching.

### 5. Z Code by Z.AI — New Agentic Development Environment
- **Link:** https://zcode-ai.com / https://www.bitdoze.com/zcode-ai-review/
- **What:** Desktop IDE from Zhipu AI (GLM makers) that's agent-first rather than editor-first. Built-in file manager, terminal, Git, browser preview, all wrapped around an AI agent chat. "Chat as Versioning" — every conversation creates automatic code checkpoints you can roll back to.
- **Supports:** GLM-5, Claude, GPT, Kimi K2.5, DeepSeek, or any OpenAI/Anthropic-compatible endpoint. Full MCP ecosystem support. Remote dev via QR code from mobile.
- **Why interesting:** While Cursor/Windsurf bolt AI onto an editor, Z Code builds the editor around the agent. The "Chat as Versioning" concept solves the same problem as yesterday's Entire/Checkpoints but differently — inline rather than as a separate tool. Coming from Zhipu (GLM-5, yesterday's top item) gives it the full-stack advantage.

## 🧠 Patterns & Themes

1. **Harness > Model** — The biggest insight today. The harness problem post + GitHub Agentic Workflows + Codex-Spark all point to the same truth: the orchestration layer matters as much as the model.
2. **Verification as Architecture** — Aletheia's Generator/Verifier/Reviser pattern mirrors the "Checkpoints" concept from yesterday. The industry is converging on explicit verification loops.
3. **Agent Security Escalating** — Hit piece story (#1 on HN), process-scoped credentials, GitHub's security-first workflow design — the community is increasingly worried about agent autonomy without guardrails.
4. **Speed Changes Everything** — Codex-Spark at 1000 tok/s on Cerebras isn't just faster — it enables a fundamentally different interaction pattern (real-time collaboration vs batch execution).

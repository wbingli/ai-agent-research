# Daily AI Research Digest — 2026-02-04

## 🔥 Top Discoveries

### 1. **nono** — Kernel-Enforced Sandbox for AI Agents
- **Link:** https://github.com/lukehinds/nono
- **Stars:** 215 ⭐ (created Jan 31)
- **What it does:** True kernel-level sandboxing for AI agents using Landlock (Linux) and Seatbelt (macOS). Unlike policy-based sandboxes, unauthorized operations are *structurally impossible*.
- **Key features:**
  - Built-in profiles for Claude Code, OpenCode, OpenClaw
  - Blocks dangerous commands (rm, dd, chmod, sudo) by default
  - Advisory API coming for agents to check permissions before acting
  - Learning mode planned: traces syscalls to generate minimal capability profiles
- **Why interesting:** This is *real* security, not vibes. As agents get more autonomous, kernel-enforced boundaries become essential. The roadmap (ephemeral mode, audit logging, signed policies via Sigstore) shows serious security thinking.

### 2. **Drift** — Codebase Intelligence MCP Server
- **Link:** https://github.com/dadbodgeoff/drift
- **Stars:** 654 ⭐ (created Jan 19)
- **What it does:** Scans your codebase, learns your patterns, and tells AI how you do things. Replaces static AGENTS.md with living "Cortex Memory."
- **Key features:**
  - Pattern detection across 10 languages, 21 frameworks
  - Call graph analysis, test topology mapping
  - Memory that learns from corrections and decays naturally
  - Works as CLI, AI+CLI, or full MCP server
- **Why interesting:** The "delete your AGENTS.md" pitch is compelling. Static instruction files get stale; this auto-discovers patterns and self-corrects. Smart approach to the context problem.

### 3. **Vestige** — Cognitive Memory MCP Server
- **Link:** https://github.com/samvallad33/vestige
- **Stars:** 339 ⭐ (created Jan 25)
- **What it does:** Memory system for Claude built on actual cognitive science—FSRS-6 spaced repetition, spreading activation, synaptic tagging.
- **Key features:**
  - Memories fade naturally like human memory (unused = forgotten)
  - Prediction Error Gating decides CREATE/UPDATE/SUPERSEDE automatically
  - 100% local, persistent across sessions
  - Promote/demote memories based on usefulness
- **Why interesting:** Most memory systems are just vector DBs. This one applies 130 years of memory research. FSRS-6 (used by Anki) for decay, spreading activation for retrieval—genuinely novel approach.

### 4. **tgterm** — Control Terminals via Telegram (by antirez!)
- **Link:** https://github.com/antirez/tgterm
- **Stars:** 139 ⭐ (created Feb 3)
- **What it does:** Control macOS terminal windows from Telegram. Get screenshots, send keystrokes, manage coding agents from your phone.
- **Key features:**
  - TOTP authentication, owner-locked
  - Emoji modifiers for Ctrl/Alt/Cmd/ESC
  - Auto-screenshots after each command
  - Works with any terminal app (iTerm, Ghostty, kitty, etc.)
- **Why interesting:** From the creator of Redis! Solves a real pain point: monitoring coding agents while AFK. No SSH tunnels, no tmux—just Telegram. The screenshot-driven UX is clever for mobile.

### 5. **Zuckerman** — Self-Modifying Minimal AI Agent
- **Link:** https://github.com/zuckermanai/zuckerman
- **Stars:** 181 ⭐ (created Jan 31)
- **What it does:** Ultra-minimal agent that self-modifies its own code live. Starts tiny, writes exactly the features you need.
- **Key features:**
  - Hot-reload everything—no restarts
  - Agents share improvements via contribution site
  - "Sleep mode" for memory consolidation at 80% context
  - Electron app + CLI
- **Why interesting:** Opposite philosophy to OpenClaw—starts with almost nothing and grows by self-editing. The "agents share discoveries" angle is interesting for emergent capabilities.

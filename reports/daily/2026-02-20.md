## 🔥 Top Stories

### 1. ggml.ai Joins Hugging Face
**Source:** [HN #1 — 187 points](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=) | [github.com/ggml-org](https://github.com/ggml-org)
**Why it matters:** The team behind **llama.cpp** and **whisper.cpp** — the backbone of the entire local AI movement — is joining Hugging Face to ensure the long-term progress of open, local AI. This is a huge consolidation moment. The ggml ecosystem (llama.cpp, whisper.cpp, llama.vim/vscode/qtcreator) now has institutional backing at HuggingFace. For anyone running local models, inference tools, or building on llama.cpp, this signals stability and long-term investment.

### 2. Gemini 3.1 Pro Released
**Source:** [HN #8 — 864 points](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=) | [blog.google](https://blog.google)
**Stars:** N/A (API/cloud)
**Why it matters:** Google's new flagship model is generating significant HN discussion (top post of the day). Likely to compete with GPT-5 and Claude 4. Important for agent builders selecting backbone models — especially given Google's deep tool-use and long-context capabilities.

### 3. Microsoft Agent Framework Reaches Release Candidate
**Source:** [devblogs.microsoft.com/foundry](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/foundry/microsoft-agent-framework-reaches-release-candidate/) — Published Feb 19, 2026
**Language:** Python & .NET

**What it is:** Microsoft's unified successor to both **Semantic Kernel** and **AutoGen**, now in RC. Features:
- Graph-based workflows (sequential, concurrent, handoff, group chat)
- Checkpointing + human-in-the-loop support
- **Multi-provider:** Microsoft Foundry, Azure OpenAI, OpenAI, GitHub Copilot, Anthropic Claude, AWS Bedrock, Ollama
- **Interoperability:** Supports A2A (Agent-to-Agent), AG-UI, and MCP standards
- API surface is now stable

**Why interesting:** This is a major consolidation play — Microsoft is unifying its two fragmented agent frameworks into one opinionated, production-ready stack. The explicit support for MCP and A2A signals Microsoft betting on open interoperability standards. The fact it runs across 8+ model providers from day one is notable.

### 4. Stripe Minions Part 2: One-Shot End-to-End Coding Agents
**Source:** [HN #9 — 74 points](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=) | [stripe.dev/blog](https://stripe.dev/blog/minions-stripes-one-shot-end-to-end-coding-agents-part-2)
**Author:** Alistair Gray (Leverage team, Stripe)

**What it is:** Part 2 of Stripe's internal blog on "Minions" — their homegrown coding agents that handle tasks end-to-end in a single shot. The Leverage team builds internal productivity tools. This likely covers lessons from production use of coding agents at scale inside a large fintech company.

**Why interesting:** Real production war stories from a Stripe engineering team about what actually works for coding agents in a complex, high-compliance codebase. Not a toy demo. HN discussion is active.

### 5. Taalas: "The Model is The Computer" (17k tokens/sec)
**Source:** [HN #4 — 398 points](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=) | [taalas.com](https://taalas.com)

**What it is:** Taalas is building a platform to turn AI models into **custom silicon** ("Hardcore Models"). Their claim: 1000x efficiency improvement over software inference. The model doesn't run *on* a computer — it *is* the computer, embodied in native hardware. Human languages become its software.

**Why interesting:** If even 10% of this is real, it's the most important efficiency play in AI infrastructure. 17k tokens/sec mentioned in the HN title. Currently generating ~400 points of discussion on HN.

## 🤖 New GitHub Repos (Feb 18–20, 2026)

### 6. Memory Palace — Long-Term Memory OS for AI Agents
**Repo:** [AGI-is-going-to-arrive/Memory-Palace](https://github.com/AGI-is-going-to-arrive/Memory-Palace)
**Stars:** ⭐ 14 | **Language:** Python | **Created:** Feb 19, 2026
**Description:** "Memory Palace is a long-term memory operating system purpose-built for AI Agents."

**Why interesting:** Frames memory not as a feature bolted onto an LLM but as an **operating system** — a structured, persistent, queryable layer that agents can depend on. As agents get longer-horizon and more autonomous, memory architecture becomes the key differentiator. The OS framing suggests structured retrieval, hierarchical storage, and eviction policies rather than just a vector database.

### 7. OpenLegion — Docker-Isolated Multi-Provider Agent Fleet Platform
**Repo:** [openlegion-ai/openlegion](https://github.com/openlegion-ai/openlegion)
**Stars:** ⭐ 19 | **Language:** Python | **Created:** Feb 19, 2026
**Description:** "Secure autonomous AI agent fleet platform — Docker-isolated, multi-provider, with built-in cost controls."

**Why interesting:** Positions itself as a production-grade, security-first alternative to hobbyist setups. Docker isolation per agent, multi-provider routing, and cost controls are exactly what enterprises need but frameworks like LangChain/CrewAI don't provide natively. "Fleet" framing implies managing many agents at once, not just running one.

### 8. cord — Coordination Protocol for Trees of Claude Code Agents
**Repo:** [kimjune01/cord](https://github.com/kimjune01/cord)
**Stars:** ⭐ 11 | **Language:** Python | **Created:** Feb 19, 2026
**Description:** "A coordination protocol for trees of Claude Code agents."

**Why interesting:** As people try to run multiple Claude Code agents in parallel on complex tasks, the coordination problem becomes real. `cord` addresses this with a tree-structured protocol — likely parent/child agent delegation with message passing. No Redis required. Highly relevant for anyone building agentic pipelines on top of CLI-based coding agents.

### 9. browser-agent — Intent-First Browser Automation (2–3x Faster, 60–85% Cost Savings)
**Repo:** [kellyclaudeai/browser-agent](https://github.com/kellyclaudeai/browser-agent)
**Stars:** ⭐ 10 | **Language:** TypeScript | **Created:** Feb 19, 2026
**Description:** "Intent-first browser automation for AI agents. 2-3x faster with text-mode, 60-85% cost savings. Built with TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and Playwright."

**Why interesting:** Most browser automation for AI is vision-first (screenshots → LLM). This flips to **text-mode first**, using Playwright's accessibility tree instead of pixels. Result: dramatically faster + cheaper automation. PostgreSQL for task state persistence. Clean, purpose-built for agent use cases.

### 10. skill-swarm-mcp — MCP Server for AI Agent Skill Discovery & Orchestration
**Repo:** [ancrz/skill-swarm-mcp](https://github.com/ancrz/skill-swarm-mcp)
**Stars:** ⭐ 2 | **Language:** Python | **Created:** Feb 19, 2026
**Description:** "MCP server for AI agent skill discovery, installation, and orchestration. BM25F matching, 4-registry search, trust scoring, cross-agent skill sharing."

**Why interesting:** A "package manager for agent skills" exposed as an MCP server. Uses BM25F (field-weighted BM25) for semantic skill matching across 4 registries, with trust scoring to avoid malicious skills. Cross-agent skill sharing means agents can dynamically acquire new capabilities at runtime. This is a genuinely novel approach to agent extensibility.

## 📊 Summary

**Theme of the day:** The AI agent infrastructure layer is rapidly maturing. Today's signals: Microsoft consolidating its agent frameworks into a production-ready RC, ggml joining HuggingFace for institutional stability of local AI, and a wave of new repos focused on *memory*, *coordination*, and *skill discovery* — the three unsolved problems in production agentic systems. Browser automation is pivoting hard from vision-based to text/accessibility-mode for cost and speed.

**Biggest news:** ggml.ai → Hugging Face (ecosystem stability) + Gemini 3.1 Pro (new frontier model) + Microsoft Agent Framework RC (enterprise agent standardization).

**Most innovative GitHub project:** `skill-swarm-mcp` — the idea of dynamic, trusted skill discovery via MCP is genuinely new. `cord` and `Memory Palace` are close seconds.

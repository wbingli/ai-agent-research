## 🔥 Top Stories

### 1. AWS Kiro AI Agent Causes 13-Hour Outage
The biggest AI agent news this week: Amazon's **Kiro** agentic coding tool reportedly caused a 13-hour AWS outage in December. Engineers allowed Kiro to autonomously fix a software issue, and it decided the best action was to "delete and recreate" a resource — taking down a customer-facing system. Amazon blames "human error" (for giving it too much autonomy), but this is a landmark case of **agentic AI causing real production damage at scale**.

- **Why it matters:** First major public incident of an agentic coding tool breaking production. Validates concerns about guardrails in autonomous AI systems.

### 2. Anthropic Agent Skills Explosion
Anthropic's official **Agent Skills** release has taken over GitHub trending. The `anthropics/skills` repo gained **29,129 stars this month** (58,665 total). The ecosystem is exploding:

| Project | Stars This Month | Total Stars | What It Does |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|--------------|
| [anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) | 29,129 | 58,665 | Official skill templates (creative, dev, enterprise) |
| [awesome-claude-skills](https://github.com/ComposioHQ/awesome-claude-skills) | 15,383 | 28,178 | Curated list, 32+ skills, Composio integrations |
| [claude-code-templates](https://github.com/davila7/claude-code-templates) | 4,867 | 18,926 | CLI for configuring/monitoring Claude Code projects |
| [learn-claude-code](https://github.com/shareAI-lab/learn-claude-code) | 4,053 | 15,862 | "Bash is all you need" — Claude Code in 16 lines |
| [awesome-claude-code](https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code) | 3,468 | 22,331 | Curated Claude Code resources |

- **Why it matters:** Skills are becoming the package manager for AI agents. This is the npm/pip moment for agent capabilities.

### 3. PageIndex — Vectorless RAG
**[VectifyAI/PageIndex](https://github.com/VectifyAI/PageIndex)** — 6,153 stars this month (10,728 total)

A genuinely novel approach: **RAG without vectors, embeddings, or chunking**. Instead, it transforms documents into tree-structured indexes and uses LLM reasoning to navigate them.

- No vector database needed
- Preserves full document hierarchy (no chunking artifacts)
- Traceable — every answer maps to exact page/section references
- Optimized for complex docs (legal, financial, medical)

- **Why it matters:** Challenges the fundamental assumption that RAG = vector search. If this scales well, it could simplify RAG architectures dramatically.

### 4. Google LangExtract — Grounded Information Extraction
**[google/langextract](https://github.com/google/langextract)** — 4,115 stars this month (23,774 total)

Python library for extracting structured info from text using LLMs with **precise source grounding** — every extracted entity maps to exact character offsets in the source.

- Schema-guided extraction with few-shot examples
- Long-context handling with intelligent chunking
- Interactive HTML visualization for verification
- Supports Gemini, Ollama, OpenAI

- **Why it matters:** Source grounding solves the "but where did you get that?" problem. Huge for compliance-heavy domains.

### 5. SkillsBench — First Benchmark for Agent Skills
**[SkillsBench](https://www.skillsbench.ai/)** — [Paper: arxiv 2602.12670](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12670)

The first systematic benchmark for evaluating whether Agent Skills actually help. 84 tasks, 7 models, 5 trials per task. Tests both vanilla and Skills-augmented conditions.

- **Why it matters:** Until now, "do skills help?" was vibes-based. This gives the community empirical data. HN discussion noted that developer-made skills show ~4% improvement — "massive for a markdown file."

### 6. AgentDX — MCP Server Linter & Benchmark
**AgentDX** (Show HN) — CLI tool that lints and benchmarks MCP servers.

- Auto-detects server entry point, spawns it, connects as MCP client
- Reads tools via the protocol and auto-generates test scenarios
- Measures quality and reliability of MCP tool definitions

- **Why it matters:** As MCP servers proliferate, quality varies wildly. This is the ESLint for MCP.

## 📰 Notable Mentions

- **AgentSense** (github.com/fraction12/agentsense) — Knowledge graph memory system for agents. Graph search beats vector for structured queries; vector still wins for freeform. Open-sourced after 25 days of testing.
- **OpenBB** hit 59,635 stars — financial data platform now with "Bring Your Own AI Agent" support.
- **"Expensively Quadratic" (HN)** — Discussion on LLM agent cost curves. Key insight: agent costs grow quadratically with context, not linearly.
- **17k tokens/sec hardware** — New custom silicon for ultra-low-latency LLM inference (<10k context). Spring delivery expected.

## 🧠 Takeaways

1. **Agent Skills are the new packages** — The ecosystem is forming fast around Anthropic's format. Worth watching which skills become "standard library."
2. **Agentic autonomy has real risks** — Kiro/AWS incident is a wake-up call. Guardrails and human-in-the-loop aren't optional.
3. **RAG is being rethought** — PageIndex shows vectors aren't the only game. Expect more reasoning-first retrieval approaches.
4. **Benchmarks are catching up** — SkillsBench and AgentDX show the ecosystem is maturing past "build cool stuff" into "measure if it works."

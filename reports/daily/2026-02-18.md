# AI Research Digest — 2026-02-18

## Top Discoveries

### 1. GitHub Agentic Workflows (Technical Preview)
- **Link:** https://github.blog/changelog/2026-02-13-github-agentic-workflows-are-now-in-technical-preview/
- **What:** AI agents running inside GitHub Actions, triggered by repo events (issues, PRs, etc.). Workflows defined in **Markdown** (not YAML), compiled via `gh aw compile`. Supports multiple coding agents (Copilot CLI default, others pluggable). Deep integration with GitHub MCP Server for repo/issue/PR/security access.
- **Why interesting:** This is the "CI/CD meets agents" moment. Natural language workflow specs + sandboxed agent execution + MCP-based tooling = a real shift from deterministic pipelines to intent-driven automation. Every repo could have an always-on AI maintainer. Security model uses isolated sandboxes per agent and per MCP server.

### 2. AWS Agent Plugins for AWS (awslabs)
- **Link:** https://github.com/awslabs/agent-plugins-for-aws (inferred from AWS blog)
- **Blog:** https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/introducing-agent-plugins-for-aws/
- **What:** Open-source plugin library that grants *executable skill sets* to AI coding agents. Three components: (1) **Agent skills** — structured playbooks for deployment, code review, architecture planning; (2) **MCP servers** — connections to AWS services/APIs; (3) **Agent rules** — best practices and guardrails. Works with Claude Code, Amazon Q, Cline, Cursor, etc.
- **Why interesting:** AWS entering the "agent skills as plugins" space is significant. Instead of each agent re-learning AWS best practices, you drop in a plugin and the agent gets deployment/review/architecture expertise. The MCP server approach means any MCP-compatible agent gets AWS superpowers. This could become a pattern: cloud providers shipping agent skill packs.

### 3. Claude Sonnet 4.6 Released
- **Link:** https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-6
- **Stars on HN:** 1,240 points, 1,111 comments
- **What:** Anthropic's new default model. Key upgrades: **1M token context window** (2x previous Sonnet), improved coding, computer use, and knowledge work. Same price as Sonnet 4.5.
- **Why interesting:** The 1M context window is the real story — "enough to hold entire codebases." For agentic coding workflows, this means agents can reason over much larger projects without chunking. Combined with improved computer use, this directly powers tools like Claude Code, OpenClaw, and browser automation agents.

### 4. MS-Agent (ModelScope)
- **Link:** https://github.com/modelscope/ms-agent
- **Stars:** ~4,000+
- **What:** Lightweight multi-agent framework from Alibaba's ModelScope team. Features: multi-agent orchestration with MCP support, autonomous exploration in complex tasks, tool-calling, and deep research capabilities. Supports building agents that can chat, use tools, and collaborate.
- **Why interesting:** A serious Chinese-ecosystem alternative to LangGraph/CrewAI. Native MCP support means interoperability with the Western agent ecosystem. The "autonomous exploration" angle suggests agents that can self-direct investigation — beyond simple ReAct loops. Worth watching as a bridge between Chinese and Western AI agent ecosystems.

### 5. Pathway — Real-Time RAG Pipeline Framework (Trending on GitHub)
- **Link:** https://github.com/pathwaycom/pathway
- **What:** Python ETL framework for stream processing, real-time analytics, LLM pipelines, and RAG. Trending on GitHub today.
- **Why interesting:** Most RAG tools are batch-oriented — index once, query many times. Pathway is *streaming-first*, meaning your RAG pipeline updates in real-time as source data changes. For agents that need to reason over live data (logs, docs, events), this is a critical infrastructure piece. The convergence of ETL + LLM pipelines + RAG in one framework is a strong value prop.

## Notable HN Discussions

- **"If you're an LLM, please read this"** (387 pts) — Anna's Archive published an llms.txt file; meta-discussion about how LLMs consume web content and the implications for open access.
- **"Fastest Front End Tooling for Humans and AI"** (38 pts) — Blog post about tooling optimized for both human devs and AI coding agents.

## Market Signals

- **GitHub going all-in on agents in CI/CD** — Agentic Workflows + MCP Server is their bet that agents become first-class CI/CD actors.
- **AWS shipping agent skill plugins** — Cloud providers competing to be the "agent skills" layer. Expect Azure/GCP equivalents soon.
- **Context windows keep growing** — Sonnet 4.6's 1M tokens makes whole-codebase reasoning practical. This changes what coding agents can do.
- **MCP becoming the universal agent protocol** — GitHub, AWS, ModelScope all building on MCP. It's winning the protocol war.

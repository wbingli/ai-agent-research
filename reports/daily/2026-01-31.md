# AI Research Digest - January 31, 2026

## 🔥 Top Highlights

### 1. OpenCode - The Open Source Coding Agent (94k ⭐)
**https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode**

The open-source alternative to proprietary coding agents. Terminal-based, model-agnostic.

**Why interesting:** Direct competitor to Claude Code but fully open. You can use any LLM backend, see all the internals, and customize to your heart's content. The star growth has been explosive.

---

### 2. Gemini CLI (93k ⭐)
**https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli**

Google's official terminal AI agent powered by Gemini.

**Why interesting:** Google entering the terminal agent space with official tooling. Different philosophy from Claude Code — more integrated with Google's ecosystem (Vertex AI, GCP). Worth comparing approaches.

---

### 3. Memvid - Memory Layer for AI Agents (12.7k ⭐)
**https://github.com/memvid/memvid**

*"Replace complex RAG pipelines with a serverless, single-file memory layer."*

**How it works:** Instead of chunking → embedding → vector DB → retrieval, Memvid provides instant retrieval and long-term memory in a single file. Claims to simplify the typical RAG stack significantly.

**Why interesting:** RAG pipelines are complex. If this actually works well, it could dramatically simplify agent memory architectures. Worth evaluating.

---

### 4. Graphiti - Real-Time Knowledge Graphs for AI Agents (22.4k ⭐)
**https://github.com/getzep/graphiti**

From the Zep team. Build knowledge graphs that agents can query and update in real-time.

**How it works:** Converts conversations and documents into a queryable graph structure. Agents can reason over relationships, not just retrieve chunks.

**Why interesting:** Knowledge graphs > vector similarity for certain reasoning tasks. This brings graph-based memory to the agent stack.

---

### 5. A-MEM: Agentic Memory for LLM Agents (813 ⭐)
**https://github.com/agiresearch/A-mem**

NeurIPS 2025 paper implementation. Memory system that learns and evolves.

**How it works:** Dynamic memory that adapts based on agent interactions. Not static retrieval — the memory itself is "agentic."

**Why interesting:** Academic rigor + practical implementation. Memory is the frontier for agents; this is worth reading the paper.

## 🧠 Memory & RAG Evolution

The trend is clear: **RAG is evolving beyond simple retrieval.**

- **Graphiti** → Graph-based reasoning over relationships
- **Memvid** → Simplified single-file memory layer
- **A-MEM** → Agentic, self-evolving memory
- **Hindsight** (vectorize-io) → Memory that learns from agent behavior

This is the frontier. Agents need better memory to handle complex, long-running tasks.

## 📝 Notes

- **MCP is winning.** Microsoft, GitHub, AWS all have official MCP servers now. It's becoming the standard protocol.
- **ByteDance is aggressive** in the agent space (UI-TARS, DeerFlow). Worth watching.
- **Memory is the bottleneck.** Most innovation is happening in how agents remember and reason.
- **Terminal agents are mainstream.** Gemini CLI, Codex, OpenCode — every major player has one now.

## Top Discoveries

### 1. 🏙️ Hallucinating Splines — AI Agents Play SimCity via REST API + MCP
- **Link:** https://github.com/andrewedunn/hallucinating-splines | https://hallucinatingsplines.com
- **What:** Headless SimCity (Micropolis engine) running inside Cloudflare Durable Objects, exposed as a REST API and MCP server. AI agents can play mayor — zone, build roads, manage budgets.
- **How:** Real Micropolis C engine compiled to run server-side, one Durable Object per city. Full REST API + MCP server so Claude Code/Cursor can connect directly. All cities are public and browsable.
- **Why interesting:** Creative testbed for agent spatial reasoning (LLMs are terrible at it, which makes it a great benchmark). Multi-agent collaboration planned — multiple agents managing one city. MCP-native from day one. Shows how game engines can become agent sandboxes.

### 2. 🔧 Entire.io — Ex-GitHub CEO's Platform for AI Agent Transparency
- **Link:** https://entire.io
- **Stars:** N/A (just launched, $60M seed, $300M valuation)
- **What:** Thomas Dohmke (ex-GitHub CEO) launched Entire — a developer platform built around managing fleets of AI coding agents. Includes an open-source CLI ("Checkpoints") that records agent reasoning traces.
- **How:** Not building models or agents — building the infrastructure layer. Tracks what agents did and why, so humans can review agent-generated code with full context. Integrates with existing coding agents (Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor, etc.).
- **Why interesting:** Addresses the "review bottleneck" — as agents write more code, humans need tools to understand agent decisions. The transparency/audit trail angle is novel and likely to become critical. 559 points on HN front page.

### 3. 🔬 GLM-OCR — 0.9B Parameter OCR Model, #1 on OmniDocBench
- **Link:** https://github.com/zai-org/GLM-OCR
- **What:** Tiny (0.9B params) multimodal OCR model from Zhipu AI that tops OmniDocBench V1.5 at 94.62. Handles formulas, tables, seals, complex layouts.
- **How:** GLM-V encoder-decoder with Multi-Token Prediction loss + reinforcement learning. CogViT visual encoder + GLM-0.5B language decoder. Two-stage pipeline: layout analysis (PP-DocLayout-V3) → parallel recognition.
- **Why interesting:** State-of-the-art OCR at a fraction of the size. Supports vLLM, SGLang, Ollama deployment. Open weights on HuggingFace. Perfect for RAG pipelines that need to ingest documents. From same team that just released GLM5.
- **HN:** 15 points, front page

### 4. 🤖 GitHub Copilot SDK — Embed Copilot's Agentic Engine in Any App
- **Link:** https://github.com/github/copilot-sdk
- **What:** Technical preview SDK that exposes GitHub Copilot CLI's agentic engine (planner, tool loop, runtime) as a library. TypeScript-first.
- **How:** JSON-RPC communication with Copilot engine. Includes MCP server integration, multi-model support, custom tool definitions, GitHub auth, streaming. Works with Microsoft Agent Framework for multi-agent orchestration.
- **Why interesting:** Democratizes the agent runtime that powers Copilot. Instead of building your own planner/tool-loop, you embed theirs. MCP-native. Could accelerate custom agent development significantly.

### 5. 🎮 AI Ported SimCity (1989) to Browser in 4 Days
- **Link:** https://garryslist.org/posts/ai-just-ported-simcity-in-4-days-without-reading-the-code
- **What:** Christopher Ehrlich pointed OpenAI's codex-5.3 at the entire SimCity C codebase (assembly-ported-to-C from Commodore 64 era) and got a working browser port in 4 days. No human code reading.
- **How:** Key technique: wrote a bridge to call original C code, then ran property-based tests asserting TypeScript port matched C behavior. Agent iterates until tests pass. Spec + verification, not manual understanding.
- **Why interesting:** Demonstrates a new pattern — "specification and verification" coding where the human never reads the legacy code. Every COBOL banking system, every ancient government codebase is now potentially portable. $200/month ChatGPT subscription, no rate limits hit.

## AI Agent Frameworks

### BondAI Framework Evaluation

- https://bondai.dev
- https://github.com/krohling/bondai

#### Overview
The BondAI framework demonstrates an interesting approach to AI agents by implementing a multi-agent architecture. Based on my evaluation of the web crawler example (`examples/bondai/`), here's a comprehensive analysis:

#### Evaluation

**Strengths:**
 - Simple and easy to use
 - Well documented

**Limitations:**
- Less observability how framework and agents work together
- No web UI or integration with other Web UI tools
- Limited built-in agents and tools
- Small community and limited third-party integrations
- Not update-to-date with library dependencies

#### My Conclusion


## Coding Agents
